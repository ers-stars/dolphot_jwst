   Check the `DOLPHOT homepage <http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/>`_ to make sure you're using the most current version.

Requirements
------------

* C complier (e.g., gcc)
* PGPLOT (optional) to generate diagnostic plots 
 * `A workaround <https://github.com/kazuakiyama/homebrew-pgplot>`_) for installing PGPLOT via `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_
* Fortran complier (optional; e.g., g77, gfortan) to link to PGPLOT

DOLPHOT can be compiled and run without PGPLOT and Fortan, but it will not be able to generate diagnostic plots.

Downloads
------------

All DOLPHOT files can be downloaded from the `DOLPHOT homepage <http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/>`_.
