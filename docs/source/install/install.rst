   Check the `DOLPHOT homepage <http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/>`_ to make sure you're using the most current version.

Requirements
------------

Required: DOLPHOT is written in c/c++ and requires a c compiler (e.g., gcc) for installation.

Optional: DOLPHOT can generate diagnostic plots (e.g., PSF residuals).  Doing so requires a Fortran compiler (e.g., g77, gfortan) and PGPLOT.  PGPLOT can be obtained from its `homepage <https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/>`_ or using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ via this `workaround <https://github.com/kazuakiyama/homebrew-pgplot.`_.
