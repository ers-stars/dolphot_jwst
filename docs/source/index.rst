Welcome to Documentation for DOLPHOT's JWST NIRcam and NIRISS modules
===================================

**DOLPHOT** is a widely used software package for resolved stellar photometry.  It is written and mantained by Andrew Dolphin.  The main `DOLPHOT webpage <http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/>`_ hosts all necessary DOLPHOT files and the DOLPHOT user manuals.  This page provides information and examples for DOLPHOT applied to JWST imaging taken as part of the `Resolved Stellar Populations Early Release Science Program <https://ers-stars.github.io>`_.



**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
