User's Guide for DOLPHOT NIRCAM and NIRISS modules
===================================

**DOLPHOT** is a widely used software package for resolved stellar photometry that is written and maintained by Andrew Dolphin.  General information about DOLPHOT can be found on its `homepage <http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/>`_.

This page contains information and examples for performing photometry with DOLPHOT on JWST NIRCam and NIRISS images acquired as part of the `JWST Early Release Science Program for Resolved Stellar Populations <https://ers-stars.github.io>`_ (DD-ERS-1334).

If you make use of DOLPHOT in your work please cite `Dolphin 2000 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PASP..112.1383D/abstract>`_ and `Dolphin 2016 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft08013D/abstract>`_.  Also cite *Weisz et al. in prep* for the JWST NIRCam and NIRISS modules specifically.
