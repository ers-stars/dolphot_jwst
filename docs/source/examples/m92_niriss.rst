M92 NIRISS
======

Here we provide a working example of the reduction of M92 NIRISS data. The workflow is completely analogous to what presented in the main documentation, provided all the relevant NIRCam routines are replaced by the corresponding NIRISS routines.

Pre-processing
---------------

We start by setting up a directory in which we will perform the NIRISS reduction.
