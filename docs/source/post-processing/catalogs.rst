Creating Stellar Catalogs
=============

We now have completed a successful DOLPHOT reduction and built our photometric catalog. However, practical applications require further post-processing to ensure we work with a meaningful source list. The catalog in **outputname**.phot, in fact, contains a fairly large number of contaminant sources, including background galaxies, artifacts, blends, poorly photometered stars, etc. This is obvious by inspecting the color-magnitude diagram.
